        <h2>Research Projects</h2>

        <h3>Reducing the burden of osteoarthritis in Aotearoa New Zealand (2022-2027)</h3>
		<p>Our research centre was awarded an HRC Programme grant to investigate optimal ways to improve the management of osteoarthritis in NZ. This research programme involves a randomised clinical trial of a novel lifestyle intervention consisting of exercise therapy, dietary change, and self-management education, for people with osteoarthritis and multimorbidity; epidemiological and health economic research on the impacts of osteoarthritis prevention and management strategies, and health economic simulation modelling to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of novel treatment pathways and models of care for osteoarthritis in the New Zealand healthcare system. I am leading the simulation modelling project within this research programme. For more information on this programme, please see the CMOR website.</p>
        
        <h3>Measuring the health state preferneces of New Zealanders (2022-2026)</h3>
        <p>I was awarded a project grant from the Health Research Council of New Zealand to investigate the validity of the SF-6D health state utility instrument in the New Zealand population, to derive a NZ population value set for the SF-6D, and to develop tools to support the use of the instrument for population health and equity monitoring and cost-effectiveness evaluation of healthcare in the NZ health system. At present the SF-6D, and the SF-12 health status questionnaire from which it is derived, is widely used in clinical practice, population health monitoring, and health research in NZ, without evidence of its validity for this population or the availability of a utility value set based on preferences elicited from the NZ population. This mixed methods project will combine qualitative kaupapa Māori research methods to evaluate the appropriateness of the SF-6D for the NZ, and especially Māori, population; instrument development if required to refine the SF-6D to meet the needs of the NZ population and healthcare system; and cutting-edge discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey methods to develop a value set reflecting the preferences of the NZ population for the trade-offs between health-related quality of life domains inherent in healthcare prioritisation and funding decisions.</p>
        
        <h3>Chronic opioid use before and after joint replacement surgery (2018-ongoing)</h3>
        <p>I have received grants from the Otago Medical Research Foundation and the H.S and J.C Anderson Charitable Trust for studies of the prevalence, risk factors, and consequences of chronic opioid use before and after total hip and knee replacement surgery, using linked national population data from the IDI. Several outputs from this project are now available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We showed, using a comprehensive dataset including all joint replacement surgeries performed in the NZ public healthcare system, the continued prevalence of opioid use for as long as three years after surgery. This work has been published in the New Zealand Medical Journal and presented to the NZ Orthopaedic Association Annual Scientific Meeting.</li>
            <li>A second paper from this project identifies several important risk factors that can to help identify patients at high risk of such prolonged post-surgical opioid use, which could be useful in identifying targeted interventions to reduce opioid exposure for these at-risk groups. This paper has been published in the Journal of Arthroplasty.</li>
            <li>A third study investigates the long-term health, economic, and social impacts of perioperative opioid prescribing, and shows substantial increases in healthcare use and costs associated with preoperative opioid prescribing, but little evidence of any negative impacts of postoperative opioid prescribing to support short-term surgical recovery. This study has been published in Family Practice.</li>
            <li>A further study looking at the dose-response relationship between preoperative opioid use and long-term outcomes is in progress. An analysis plan is freely available on the Open Science Framework, and a preliminary report will be published shortly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The health economic case for implementing ACL injury prevention intervntions (2020-ongoing)</h3>
        <p>I am part of a project, led by Dr Yana Pryymachenko, that has received preliminary funding from the Health Research Council of New Zealand to investigate the impact of ACL injury prevention programmes on long-term outcomes, including the incidence and associated health and economic burden of early knee osteoarthritis. This preliminary project involves investigating the feasibility of using matching methods to identify comparable groups of individuals with and without the occurrence of an ACL injury, using comprehensive linked national data from the IDI, and to use these matched cohorts to evaluate long-term outcomes following an ACL injury. If this feasibility study proves successful, we intend to use this approach to inform cost-effectiveness evaluations of injury prevention strategies to support the implementation and uptake of such programmes across the New Zealand population (for example, via schools, sports clubs, and workplaces where people are at risk of ACL injury).</p>
